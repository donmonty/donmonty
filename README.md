# Hi! Montero here.
I'm a full stack engineer and marketer. I enjoy working with startups, helping them build products and internal tools. I am a self-taught developer and everything I know I have learned by building interesting B2B products.

## Featured Projects

### [NubeBar](https://github.com/donmonty/api-nubebar-django)
NubeBar is a mobile app that helps bars and restaurants manage their alcohol inventory in order to avoid theft and boost revenue. For most bars and restaurants alcohol sales represent 40% or more of total sales. Alcohol also has the highest margins and is the most valuable inventory. Despite this, most businesses manage their alcohol inventory using manual, time-consuming methods that make inventory control a big challenge. NubeBar solves this problem.

Thanks to NubeBar's bar code and QR scanner, bar managers can do full inventory counts in a matter of minutes, not hours. And with the help of NubeBar's analytics module, bar managers have a detailed view of their inventory over time. NubeBar highlights any differences between reported sales and actual alcohol consumption, allowing bar managers to uncover theft or malpractice at the bottle level with milliliter precision.

I built the app using React Native, Django and Postgres. I like to think that I worked as a full stack entrepreneur because I did everything: customer research and development, sales, UX design, frontend development, backend development and customer support.

### [Parking Lot Search App](https://airgarage-client.herokuapp.com/)
An app that connects to the Yelp API and searches for the worst rated parking spaces in America. Built for [Air Garage](https://www.airgarage.com/), a YC startup that automates the operation of parking lots and enables churches and businesses to rent out parking to drivers on demand. 
Although the app looks quite simple, it deals with a couple of technical challenges under the hood. First, it's not possible to make requests to the Yelp API using a regular frontend client. Second, the Yelp API does not provide any functionality to search and sort businesses by reverse ratings. To solve these challenges the app includes a backend that handles requests to the Yelp API and performs a series of tricks to sort parking lots from worst rated to best, maintaining a nice set of paginated results. 

Built with:
- React
- Styled components
- Node / Express

## Featured Projects

### [NubeBar](https://github.com/donmonty/api-nubebar)
NubeBar is a SaaS app that helps bars and restaurants manage their alcohol inventory with ease and maximum precision in order to avoid theft and boost revenue. For most bars and restaurants alcohol sales represent 40% or more of total sales. Alcohol also has the highest margins and is the most valuable inventory. Despite this, most businesses manage their alcohol inventory using manual, time-consuming methods that make inventory control a big challenge. NubeBar solves this problem.

I built the backend using Django, Django REST Framework and Postgres.

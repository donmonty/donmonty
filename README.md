## Featured Projects

### [NubeBar](https://github.com/donmonty/api-nubebar)
NubeBar is a SaaS app that helps bars and restaurants manage their alcohol inventory with ease and maximum precision in order to avoid theft and boost revenue. For most bars and restaurants alcohol sales represent 40% or more of total sales. Alcohol also has the highest margins and is the most valuable inventory. Despite this, most businesses manage their alcohol inventory using manual, time-consuming methods that make inventory control a big challenge. NubeBar solves this problem.

I built the backend using Django, Django REST Framework and Postgres.

### [Onion Grocery Store](https://github.com/theoradicella/Final-Project)
A fully-featured ecommerce site built from scratch as part of Henry, a 700 hour coding bootcamp. The site was built with React, Redux, Express, Sequelize and Postgres. I worked as part of a 8 person team, following the SCRUM agile methodology. My responsibilities included overseeing the backend development and acting as a tech leader.

### [Parking Lot Search App](https://airgarage-client.herokuapp.com/)
An app that connects to the Yelp API and searches for the worst rated parking spaces in America. Built for [Air Garage](https://www.airgarage.com/), a startup that automates the operation of parking lots and enables churches and businesses to rent out parking to drivers on demand. 
Although the app looks quite simple, it deals with a couple of technical challenges under the hood. First, it's not possible to make requests to the Yelp API using a regular frontend client. Second, the Yelp API does not provide any functionality to search and sort businesses by reverse ratings. To solve these challenges the app includes a backend that handles requests to the Yelp API and performs a series of tricks to sort parking lots from worst rated to best, maintaining a nice set of paginated results. 

Built with:
- React
- Custom hooks
- Styled components
- Node / Express

### Country Tours
A site that showcases a collection of countries and their featured tours. The site was built as part of Henry, a 700 hour coding bootcamp. Built with React, Redux, Express, Sequelize and Postgres.

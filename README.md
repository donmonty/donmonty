## Featured Projects

### [NubeBar](https://github.com/donmonty/api-nubebar)
NubeBar is a SaaS app that helps bars and restaurants manage their alcohol inventory with ease and maximum precision in order to avoid theft and boost revenue. For most bars and restaurants alcohol sales represent 40% or more of total sales. Alcohol also has the highest margins and is the most valuable inventory. Despite this, most businesses manage their alcohol inventory using manual, time-consuming methods that make inventory control a big challenge. NubeBar solves this problem.

I built the backend using Django, Django REST Framework and Postgres.

### [Parking Lot Search App](https://airgarage-client.herokuapp.com/)
An app that connects to the Yelp API and searches for the worst rated parking spaces in America. Built for [Air Garage](https://www.airgarage.com/), a startup that automates the operation of parking lots and enables churches and businesses to rent out parking to drivers on demand. 
Although the app looks quite simple, it deals with a couple of technical challenges under the hood. First, it's not possible to make requests to the Yelp API using a regular frontend client. Second, the Yelp API does not provide any functionality to search and sort businesses by reverse ratings. To solve these challenges the app includes a backend that handles requests to the Yelp API and performs a series of tricks to sort parking lots from worst rated to best, maintaining a nice set of paginated results. 

Built with:
- React
- Custom hooks
- Styled components
- Node / Express

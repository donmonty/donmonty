# Hi! Montero here.
I'm a product builder and marketer. I enjoy working with early stage startups, helping them build products and internal tools. I am a self-taught developer and everything I know I have learned by building interesting products that make money.

## Featured Projects

### [NubeBar](https://github.com/donmonty/api-nubebar-django)
NubeBar is a mobile app that helps bars and restaurants manage their alcohol inventory in order to avoid theft and boost revenue. For most bars and restaurants alcohol sales represent 40% or more of total sales. Alcohol also has the highest margins and is the most valuable inventory. Despite this, most businesses manage their alcohol inventory using manual, time-consuming methods that make inventory control a big challenge. NubeBar solves this problem.

I built the app using React Native, Django and Postgres. I like to think that I worked as a full stack entrepreneur because I did everything: customer research and development, sales, UX design, frontend development, backend development and customer support.

### [Parking Lot Search App](https://airgarage-client.herokuapp.com/)
An app that connects to the Yelp API and searches for the worst rated parking spaces in America. Built for [Air Garage](https://www.airgarage.com/), a YC startup that automates the operation of parking lots and enables churches and businesses to rent out parking to drivers on demand. 
Although the app looks quite simple, it deals with a couple of technical challenges under the hood. First, it's not possible to make requests to the Yelp API using a regular frontend client. Second, the Yelp API does not provide any functionality to search and sort businesses by reverse ratings. To solve these challenges the app includes a backend that handles requests to the Yelp API and performs a series of tricks to sort parking lots from worst rated to best, maintaining a nice set of paginated results. 

Built with:
- React
- Styled components
- Node / Express
